            <p className="md:text-base text-sm">
              The origin of the Nigeria Police Academy dates back to the early
              80s when the Government of Nigeria in 1981 requested the British
              Government to make available to Nigeria, some united Kingdom
              Police officers to assess the training needs of The Nigeria
              Police.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response to this request, a team of three British Police
              officers led by M.A. H Pacy ( Assistant Chief Constable,
              Hamberside Police) was sent to Nigeria by the British Government.
              The team submitted its report known as the pacy report in 1982.
              This report was formally published as the white paper of the
              Federal Republic, of Nigeria, on the future training needs of the
              Nigeria Police Force. A follow up of recommendations of the pacy
              report led to the search for the best training orientation for The
              Nigeria Police.
            </p>
            <p>
              The The Academy officially took off simultaneously in 1988 at two
              temporary campuses; the Police training school Challawa, Kano
              where cadet Inspectors were trained; and the Police college
              Kaduna, where cadet ASPs were trained. The two campuses were
              merged and relocated to its permanent site in Wudil, Kano, after
              its was formerly Commissioned on the 2nd April,1996, by then Head
              of State and Commander in Chief of the Armed forces, General Sani
              Abacha, GCON, dss, mni., with the expectation that the Academy
              will be affiliated to a University for degree awarding courses.
